208 DE LIBRIS

Save in their “ case‚'’ with High and Low,
Small need has he to grapple !
Without dissent he still can go
To his accustomed “ Chapel.’' ¹

From ills that others scape or shirk,
He rarely fails to rally 3

For him, his most “ composing '' work
Is labour of the “ galley.’'

Though ways be foul, and days are dim,
He makes no lamentation 3

The primal ‘⁶ fount '’ of woe to him
Is——want of occupation ε

And when, at last, Time finds him grey
With over-close attention,

He solves the problem of the day,
And gets an Old Age pension.

1 This, derived, it is said, from Caxton's connection with westminster
Abbey, is the name given to the meetings held by printers to consider trade
affairs, appeals, etc. (Psinters⁷ Vocabulary).
