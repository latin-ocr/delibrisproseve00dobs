Throughout all Fiction still, where chance
Allies Life's dulness with its dreams—
Allies what is, with what but seems,—u

Fact and Romance :—

O Knight of fire and Squire of earth 1-
O changing give-and-take between

Three centuries past,—in sunburned SPAIN,
And hang, on Time's PANTHEON wall,
My votive tablet to recall
That lasting gain !
