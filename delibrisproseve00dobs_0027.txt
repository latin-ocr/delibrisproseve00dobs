Did She live yesterday or ages back ?
What colour were the eyes when bright and waking?

And were your ringlets fair, or brown, or black‚

“ Ages back '' she certainly did not live, for the book
is dated “ 1637,'' and “ yesterday ’‘ is absurd. But
that her eyes were bright‚——nay, that they were
particularly lively and vivacious, even as they are in
the sanguine sketches of Antoine Watteau a hundred
years afterwards, I am “confidous''—as Mrs.
Slipslop would say. For my theory (in reality a
foregone conclusion which I shrink from dis-
persing by any practical resolvent) is, that Mlle. de
Mons was some delightful seventeenth—century
French child, to whom the big volume had been
presented as a picture-book. I can imagine the
alert‚ strait-corseted little figure, with ribboned hair,
eagerly craning across the tall folio; and follow-
ing curiously with her finger the legends under the
copper “ figures,'’—“Narcisse en fieur‚'' “ Ascalaphe
en hibou‚’' “Jason endormant le dragon,'’—and
so forth, with much the same wonder that the
Sinne-Beelden of Jacob Cats must have stirred

¹ This quatrain has the distinction of having been touched upon by Thackeray.
When ΜΓ. Locker's manuscript went to the Cornlzill [Wagazinc in 1860, it ran
thus :

Dicl she live yesterday, or ages sped?

What colour were the eyes when bright and waking?
Ami were your ringlets fair? Poor little head !

-Poor little heart l that long has <lone with aching.
