And long might'st thou have seen
An old man wandering ιω in quest qssomeffihzg,
Something he could not find—he knew not what.

The American Nom, 1842, was a further offering
from Dickens. Among other gifts may be noted
Wordsworth's Poems, 1827-35 ; Campbell's Pilgrim
of Glencoe, 18423 Longfellow's Ballads and Voices
of tlze Niglzt, 1840-23 Macaulay's Lays and
Tennyson’s Poems, 18423 and lastly‚ Hazlitt's
Criticisms on Art, 1844, and Carlyle's Letters and
Speeclzes of Cromwell, 1846. Brougham's philo-
sophical novel of Albert Lunel; or, tlte Cltcfteau of
Languea'oc, 3 vols. 1844, figures in the catalogue
as “withdrawn.'‘ It had been suppressed “for
private reasons'' upon the eve of publicati0n3 and
this particular copy being annotated by Rogers (to
whom it was inscribed) those concerned were no
doubt all the more anxious that it should not get
abroad. Inspection of the reprint of 1872 shows,
however, that want of interest was its chief error.
A reviewer of 1858 roundly calls it “feeble'' and
“ commonplace '' ; and it could hardly have increased
its Writer's reputation. Indeed‚ by some, it was not
supposed to be from his Lordship's pen at all.
Rogers, it may be added, frequently annotated his
books. His copies of Pope, Gray and Scott had many
marginalia. Clarke's and Fox’s histories of James ΙΙ.
were also works which he decorated in this way.
