MODERN BOOK ILLUSTRATORS 121

Seven Years' War. Excellent, too, are John Gay‘s
ambling Journey to Exeter, the Angler’s Song from
Walton (which gives its name to the collection), and
Fielding's rollicking ‘⁶ A-hunting we will go.’' Other
“ Cranford '' books, which now followed, were James
Lane Allen's Kentucky Cardinal, 1901 3 F anny
Burney’s Evehmz, 19033 Thackeray's Esmond, 1905;
and two of George Eliot's novels—Scenes qs Clerical
Life, 1906, and Silas Marner, 1907. In 1899 Mr.
Thomson had also undertaken another book for

George Allen, an edition of Reade's Peg Woffington,
—a task in which he took the keenest delight,

particularly in the burlesque character of Triplet.
These were all in the old pen—work; but some of
the designs for Silas Mamer were lightly and taste-
fully coloured. This was a plan the author had
adopted, with good effect, not only in a special
edition of Cranford (1898), but for some of his
original drawings which came into the market after
exhibition. Nothing can be more seductive than 3
Hugh Thomson pen-sketch, when delicately tinted
in sky-blue, rose-Du Barry, and apple—green (the
vert-pomme dear--as Gautier says—to the soft
moderns)—a treatment which lends them a subdued
but indefinable distinction, as of old china with a
pedigree, and fully justifies the amiable enthusiasm
of the phrase-maker who described their inventor
as the “ Charles Lamb of illustration.''
