A SONG OF THE GREENAWAY CHILD

As I went a-walking on Lavender Hill,

O, I met a Darling in frock and frill ;

And she looked at me Shyly, with eyes of blue,

“ Are you going a-walking ? Then take me too ! ’'

So we Strolled to the field where the cowslips grow,

And we played—and we played, for an hour or so 3
Then We climbed to the top of the old park wall,
And the Darling she threaded a cowslip ball.

Then we played again, till I said—“ My Dear,
This pain in my side, it has grown severe ;

Ι ought to have mentioned I'm past three-score,
And I fear that I scarcely can play any more ! '’

But the Darling she answered‚—“ O no l O no I
You must play—you must play.—-I sha‘n't let you

o 1 ’'
—Angd I woke with a start and a sigh of despair,

And I found myself safe in my Grandfather’s-chair l
