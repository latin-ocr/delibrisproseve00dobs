BRAMSTON'S “MAN OF TASTE’‘ 37

But we must abridge our levies on Pope‘s imitator.
In Dress the Man of Taste's aim seems to have
been to emulate his own footman‚ and at this point
comes in the already quoted reference to velvet
“inexpressibles''—(a word Which, the reader may
be interested to learn, is as old as 1793). His
“pleasures,'' as might be expected, like thosc of
Goldsmith‘s SwitzerS‚ “ are but low ''—

To boon companions I my time would give,
With players, pimps‚ and parasitos I'd live.

I would with Jockeys from Newmarket dine,
And to Rough-riders give my choicest wine. . .
My ev’nings all Ι would with sharpers spend,
And make the Thief-catcher my bosom friend.
ln Fz'g, the Prize-fighter‚ by day delight,

And sup with Colly Cibber ev’ry night.

At which point—and probably in his cups-—we
leave our misguided fine gentleman of 1733, doubt-
less a fair sample of many of his class under the
second George, and not wholly unknown under that
monarch's successors—even to this hour. Le jour va
passer; mais la folie ne passera pas ,Ι

A parting quotation may serve to illustrate one
of those changes of pronunciation which have taken
place in so many English words. Speaking of his

villa, or country-box, the Man of Taste says—-

Pots o'cr the door I’ll place like Cits balconies,
Which Bently calls the Gardens ofAdom‘s.
