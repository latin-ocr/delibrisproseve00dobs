made to realise each separate scene with strict relation
to its text.

All of the “Coverley'' series came out in the
English Illustrated. So also did the designs for the
next book, the Coczching Days and Coaclzing Ways of
ΜΓ. Outram Tristram‚ 1888. Here Mr. Thomson
had a topographical collaborator, ΜΓ. Herbert
Railton‚ who did the major part of the very effective
drawings in this kind. But Mr. Thomson's con—
tributions may fairly be said to have exhausted the

keepers, mail-coaches struggling in snoW-drifts,
mail-coaches held up by highvvaymen, overturns,
elopements‚ cast shoeS, snapped poles, lost linch-pins‚
—all the episodes and moving accidents of bygone
travel on the high road have abundant illustration‚
till the pages seem almost to reek of the stableyard,
or ring with the horn.1 And here it may be noted,
as a peculiarity of ΜΓ. Thomson's conscientious
horse—drawing, that he depicts, not the ideal, but

“Swift and Bolingbroke at Bucklebury’' (p. 30); “Charles II. recognise‹l by
the Ostler” (p. 144), and ‘⁴ Barry Lynzlon cracks a Bottle” (p. 116). Barry
Lyndm with its picaresque note and Irish background, would seem an excellent
contribution to the “Cranford” series. Why does not Mr. Thomson try his
hand at it? He has illustrated Esmond, :md the szt Hoggarty Di 111111 i.
