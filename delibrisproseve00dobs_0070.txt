the Fifteenth, above which is a delicate headpiece
by M. Charles—Nicolas Cochin (the greatest of the
family), where a couple of that artist's well—nourished
amarini, insecurely attached to festoons, distribute
palms and laurels in vacuity under a coroneted
oval displaying fishes. For Monsieur Abel-Francois
Poisson, Marquis de Marigny et de Menars, was
the younger brother of Jeanne-Antoinette Poisson,
the celebrated Marquise de Pompadour. Cochin's
etching is dated “ 1754 ’‘ ; and the “Approbation’'
at the end of the volume bears his signature in his
capacity of Censeur.

Of the “ M. Rouquet '² of the title—page biography
tells us little; but it may be well, before speaking
of his book, to bring that little together. He was
a Swiss Protestant of French extraction, born at
Geneva in 1702. His Christian names were Jean-
Andre3 and he had corne to England from his
native land towards the close of the reign of George
the First. Many of his restless compatriots also
sought these favoured shores. Labelye, who rose
from a barber's shop to be the architect of London
Bridge; Liotard, once regarded as a rival of
Reynolds; Michael Moser, eventually Keeper of
the Royal Academy‚ had all migrated from the
“stormy mansions'' where, in the words of Gold—
smith‘s philosophie Wanderer—

Winter ling‘ring chills the lap of May.
