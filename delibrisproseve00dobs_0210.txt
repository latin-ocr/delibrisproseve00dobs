cobbler ; Lismahago and Tabitha Bramble3 the caustic
Mrs. Selwyn and the blushing Miss Anville. Be cer-
tain, too, that, sooner or later, you will encounter Mrs.
Candour and Lady Sneerwell, Sir Benjamin Backbite
and his uncle, Mr. Crabtree‚ for this is their main
haunt and region—in fact, they were born here.
You may follow this worshipful and piebald proces—
sion to the Public Breakfasts in the Spring GardenS, to
the Toy—shops behind the Church, to the Coffee-houses
in Westgate Street‚ to the Reading Rooms on the
Walks, where, in Mr. James Leake’s parlour at the
back—if you are lucky—you may behold the cele-
brated Mr. Ralph Allen of Prior Park, talking either
to Mr. Henry Fielding or to Mr. Leake's brother-
in-law, Mr. Samuel Richardson, but never—if we are
correctly informed—to both of them together. Or
you may run against Mr. Christopher Anstey of the
over-praised Guide, walking arm-in-arm with another
Bathonian‚ Mr. Melmoth, whose version of Pliny
was once held to surpass its original. At the Abbey
—where there are daily morning services—you shall
listen to the silver periods of Bishop Hurd, whom
his admirers call fondly “ the Beauty of Holiness '' ;
at St. James’s you can attend the full-blown lectures‚
“more unctuous than ever he preached,'’ of Bishop
Beilby Porteus ; or you may succeed in procuring a

card for a select hearing, at Edgar Buildings, of Lady
Huntingdon's eloquent chaplain‚ Mr. Whitefield.
