THE LAST PROOF

AN EPILOGUE TO ANY BOOK

“ Hic Finis chartaeque viaeque.’‘

“ F1le at last—the end, the End, the END l

No more of paragraphs to prune or mend ;

ΝΟ more blue pencss, with its ruthless line,

To blot the phrase ‘ particularly fine ' 3

No more of ‘ slips,’ and ‘ galleys‚’ and ‘ revises,'

Of words ‘ transmogrified‚' and ‘ wild surmises' ;

No more of n's that masquerade as zc's,

No nice perplexities ofp’s and q’s ;

No more mishaps of ante and of post,

That most mislead when they should help the most ;

No more of ‘ friend ' as ‘ fiend,' and ‘ warrn ' as
‘ worm ' ;

No more negations where we would affirm ;

No more of those mysterious freaks of fate

That make us bless when we should execrate ;

No more of those Iast blunders that remain

Where we no more can set them right again ;
