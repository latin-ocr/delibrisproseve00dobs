THE BOOKS OF SAMUEL ROGERS

ΟΝΕ common grave, according to Garrick, covers the
actor and his art. The same may be said of the
raconteur. Oral tradition, or even his own writings,
may preserve his precise words ; but his peculiarities
of voice or action, his tricks of utterance and in-
tonation‚—all the collateral details which serve to
lend distinction or piquancy to the performance—
perish irrecoverably. The glorified gramophone of
the future may perhaps rectify this for a new genera-
tion ; and give us, without mechanical drawback, the
authentic accents of =speakers dead and gone3 but
it can never perpetuate the dramatic accompaniment
of gesture and expression. If, as always, there are
exceptions to this rule‚ they are necessarily evanescent.
Now and then, it may be, some elever mimic will
recall the manner of a passed-away predecessor3 and
he may even contrive to hand it on, more or less
effectually, to a disciple. But the reproduction
is of brief duration3 and it is speedily effaced or

transformed.
