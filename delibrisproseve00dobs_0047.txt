BRAMSTON'S “MAN OF TASTE''

WERE you to inquire respectfully of the infallible
critic (if such indeed there bel) for the source of
the aphorism, “ Music has charnis to soothe a savage
beast‚'’ he would probably “down'' you contempt-
uously in the Johnsonian fashion by replying that
you had “just enough of learning to misquote '' 3—
that the last word was notoriously ‘⁶ breast '' and not
“beast'’ 3—-and that the line, as Macaulay'S, and
every Board School-boy besides must be abundantly
aware, is to be found in Congreve's tragedy of lee
Mourm‘ng Bride. But he would be wrong3 and, in
fact, would only be confirming the real author’s
contention that “Sure, of all blockheads‚ Scholars
are the worst.'' For, whether connected with
Congreve or not, the words are correctly given3
and they occur in the Rev. James Bramston's satire,
lee Man of Taste‚ 1733, running in a couplet as
follows :——

Musick has charms to sooth a savage beas-t,
And therefore proper at a Sheriff's feast.
