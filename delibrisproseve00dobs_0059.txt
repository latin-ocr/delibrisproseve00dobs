BRAMSTON'S “MAN OF TASTE“ 35

the worst the best, he prefers the modern to the
antique. In Music, with Hogarth's Rake two years
later, he is all for that “Dagon of the nobility and

gentry,’' imported song :—

Without Italian, or without an ear,
To Bonomini’s musick I adhere 3-—

though he confesses to a partiality for the bagpipe on
the ground that your true Briton “ loves a grumbling
noise‚'’ and he favours organs and the popular
oratorios. But his “ top talent is a bill of fare '' :—

Sir Loins and rumpe of beef offend my eyes‚]

Pleas’d with frogs fricass[e]ed‚ and coxcomb-pies.
Dishes I chuse though little, yet genteel‚

Smin-2 the first course, and Pcepersss crown the meal.
Pigs heads with hair on, much my fancy please,

I love young colly—flowers if stew’d in cheese,

And give ten guineas for a pint of peas !

No tatling servants to my table come,

My Grace is Silcmc, and my waiter Dumh.

He is not without his aspirations.

Could I the priw'ledge of Peer procure,
The rich I’d bully, and oppress the poor.
To give is wrong, but it is wronger still,
On any terms to pay a tradesman's bill.

loads of meat . . . extreme disgusting to those who are in the least acquainted
with high life '⁹ (Citt'zeu qftlle World, 1762, i. 241).

cuisines—and gipsy campe». It was introduced into England as an epicure’s dish
in the seventeenth century.
