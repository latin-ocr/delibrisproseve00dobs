224 DE LlssRls

No more apologies for doubtful data 3

No more fresh facts that figure as Errata ;

No more, in short, O TYPE, of wayward lore
From thy most un-Pierian fount—No MORE ! ''

So spoke PAPYRIUS. Yet his hand meanwhile
Went vaguely seeking for the vacant file,
Late stored with long array of notes, but now
Bare-wired and barren as a leafless bough 3—
And even as he spoke‚ his mind began

Again to scheme, to purpose and to plan.

There is no end to Labour 'neath the sun ;
There is no end of labouring—but One ;

And though we “ twitch (or not) our Mantle blue,’'
“ To-morrow to fresh Woods, and Pastures new.’‘
