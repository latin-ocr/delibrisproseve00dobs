Fiftlz. They are “all sorts and conditions'’ of
horses3 and—if truth required it—would disclose
as many sand-cracks as Rocinante, or as many equine
defects (from wind—gall to the botts) as those imputed
to that unhappy “Blackberry’' sold by the Vicar
of Wakefield at Welbridge Fair to Mr. Ephraim
Jenkinson.

The Vicar of W akefield—as it happens—was Mr.
Thomson's next enterprise; and it is, in many
respects‚ a most memorable one. It came out in
December, 1890, having occupied him for nearly
two years. He took exceptional pains to study and
realise the several types for himself, and to ensure
correctness of costume. From the first introductory
procession of the Primrose family at the head of
chapter i. to the awkward ,merriment of the two
Miss Flamboroughs at the close, there is scarcely a
page which has not some stroke of quiet fun, some
graceful attitude, or some ingenious contrivance in
composition. Considering that from Wenham's
edition of 1780, nearly every illustrator of repute
had tried his hand at Goldsmith's masterpiece in
fiction‚—that he had been attempted without humour
by Stothard, without lightness by Mulready,¹—
that he had been made comic by Cruikshank, and
vulgarised by Rowlandson‚—-it was certainly to Mr.
Thomson’s credit that he had approached his task
