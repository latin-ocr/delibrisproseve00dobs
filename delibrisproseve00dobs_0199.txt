PEPYS’ “ DIARY ‘⁹

To One who asked why he wrote it.

Yov ask me what was his intent ?
In truth, I'm not a German 3

‘Tis plain though that he neither meant
A Lecture nor a Sermon.

But there it is,—the thing's a Fact.
I find no other reason

But that some scribbling itch attacked
Him in and out of season,

To write What no one else should read,
With this for second meaning,

To “ cleanse his bosom '' (and indeed
It sometimes wanted cleaning) ;

ΤΟ speak, as ’twere‚ his private mind,
Unhindered by repressdon,
To make his motley life a kind

Of Midas’ ears confession ;
