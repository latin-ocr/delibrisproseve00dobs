AN EPISTLE To AN EDITOR 21

Praise too the young 3 praise those who try ;
Praise those who fail, but by and by

May do good work. Those who succeed‚
You’ll praise perforce,--so there's no need
To speak of that. And as to each,

See you keep measure in your speech 3-—

See that your praise be so exprest

That the best man shall get the best3

Nor fail of the fit word you meant

Because your epithets are spent.

Remember that our language gives

No limitless superlatives ;

And SHAKESPEARE, HoMER, should have more
Than the last knocker at the door !

‘⁶ We, that are very old ! ''—May this
Excuse the hint you find amiss.
My thoughts, I feel, are what to-day
Men call vieux jeu. Well !—“ let them say.''
The Old, at least, we know : the New
(A changing Shape that all pursue l)
Has been‚—may be, a fraud.
—But there ἶ
Wind to your sail l Vogue la galbre !
