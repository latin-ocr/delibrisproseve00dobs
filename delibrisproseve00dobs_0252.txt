connection with another record of the visits of the
novelist to the old Queen of the West, a tablet
erected in June 1906 to Fielding and his sister on the
wall of Yew Cottage, now renovated as Widcombe
Lodge, VVidcombe, Bath, where they once resided.
In the last case Ι have to mention, it is but fair
to Murphy to admit that he seems to have been
better informed than those who have succeeded him.
Richardson writes of being “well acquainted '' with
four of Fielding’s sisters, and both Lawrence and
Keightley refer to a Catherine and an Ursula, of

whom Keighdey, after prolonged enquiries‚ could
obtain no tidings. With the help of Colonel W. F.

Prideaux, and the kind offices of Mr. Samuel Martin
of the Hammersmith Free Library, this matter has
now been set at rest. In 1887 Sir Leslie Stephen
had suggested to me that Catherine and Ursula were
most probably born at Sharpham Park, before the
Fieldings moved to East Stour. This must have
been the case, though Keightley had failed to establish
it. At all events, Catherine and Ursula must have
existed, for they both died in 1 750. The Hammer-
smith Registers at Fulham record the following
burials :—

17 50 July 9th‚ Mrs. Catherine F eilding (sic)

1750 Nov. 12th‚ MrS. Ursula Fielding

1750 [- 1] Feby . 24th, Mrs. Beatrice Fielding
1753 May 10th, Louisa‚ d. of Henry F ielding, Esq.
