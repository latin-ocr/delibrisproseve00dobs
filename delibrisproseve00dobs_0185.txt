THE BOOKS OF SAMUEL ROGERS 135

he loved the books he read. And, as far as can be
ascertained, he anticipated the late Master of Balliol,
since he read only the books he liked. Nor was he
ever diverted from his predilections by mere fashion
or novelty. “He followed Bacon's maxim'‘—-says
one who knew him—“to read much, not many

‘ When a new book comes out, I read an old one.' '’ ¹

The general Rogers-sale at Christie's took place
in the spring of 1856, and twelve days had been
absorbed before the books were reached. Their
sale took six days more—Le. from May 12 to
May 19. As might be expected from Rogers‘s
traditional position in the literary world, the
catalogue contains many presentation copies. What,
at first sight, would seem the earliest, is the Works
of Edward Moore, 1796, 2 vols. But if this be
the fabulist and editor of the World‚ it can scarcely
have been received from the writer, since, in 1796,
Moore had been dead for nearly forty years. With
Bloomfield's poems of 1802, l. p., we are on surer
ground, for Rogers, like Capel Lofft, had been kind
to the author of lee Farmer's B0y‚ and had done
his best to obtain him a pension. Another early
tribute, subsequently followed by the Tales of the
Hall, was Crabbe's Borough, Which he sent to
Rogers in 1810, in response to polite overtures
