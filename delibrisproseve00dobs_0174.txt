Emma.) As regards dogs and horses and the rest,
his colleague, Mr. Joseph Pennell, an expert critic,
and a most accomplished artist‚ holds that he has
“long since surpassed'’ Randolph Caldecott.l Ι
doubt whether Mr. Thomson himself would concur
with his eulogist in this. But he has assuredly
followed Caldecott close; and in opulence of pro-
duction, which—as Macaulay insisted—should always
count, has naturally exceeded that gifted, but short-
lived, designer. If, pursuing an ancient practice,
one were to attempt to label Mr. Thomson with a
special distinction apart from, and in addition to, his

other merits‚ I should be inclined to designate him
the “ Master of the Vignette,''—taking that word in

its primary sense as including head-pieces, tail-pieces
and initial letters. In this department, no draughts-
man I can call to mind has ever shown greater

fertility of invention, so much playful fancy, so
much grace, so much kindly humour, and such a

sane and wholesome spirit of fun.
