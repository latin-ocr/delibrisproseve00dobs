36 DE LlssRis

I'd make the insolent Mechanicks stay,

And keep my ready-money all for play.

l'd try if any plcasure could be found

ln tossing-asp for twenty thousand pound.
Had I whole Counties, I to White's would go,
And set lands‚ vvoods, and rivers at a throw.
But should I meet with an unlucky run,

And at a throxv be gloriously undonc ;

My debts ofhonour I'd discharge the first,
Let all my lawsul creditors be curst.

Here he perfectly exemplifies that connexion
between connoisseurship and play which Fielding
discovers in Book xiii. of Tom Jones.¹ An anecdote
of C. J. Fox aptly exhibits the final couplet in
action, and proves that fifty years later, at least,
the same convenient code was in operation. Fox
once Won about eight thousand pounds at cards.
Thereupon an eager creditor promptly presented
himself, and pressed for payment. “ Impossible‚ Sir,’'
replied Fox, “I must first discharge my debts of
honour.’' The creditor expostulated. “Well, Sir,
give me your bond.’' The bond was delivered to
Fox, who tore it up and flung the pieces into the
fire. “ Now, Sir,'' said he, “my debt to you is a
debt of honour,'’ and immediately paid him.2

¹ “ But the science of gaming is that which above all others employs their
thoughts [i.e. the thoughts of the ‘young gentlemen of our times ']. These are
the studies of their graver hours, while for their amusements they have the vast
circle of connoisseurship, painting, music, statuary, and natural philosophy, or
rather unnatural‚ which deals in the wonderful, and knows nothing of nature,
except her monsters and imperfectioris ’¹ (ch. v.).
