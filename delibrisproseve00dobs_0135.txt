MODERN BOOK ILLUSTRATORS 101

And they knocked‚ and called, and entreated
Whoever should be within ;

But all to no purpose, for no one
Would hearken to let thern in.

“La rime n'est pas riclze,'' nor is the technique
thoroughly assured3 but the thought is poetical.
Here is another, “In an Apple—Tree,’' which reads
like a child variation of that haunting ‘⁶ Mimnermus
in Church ” of the author of Ionica :—

In September, when the apples are red,

To Belinda I said,

“Would you like to go away

To Heaven, or stay

Here in this orchard full of trees

All your life ? ’' And she said, ‘⁴ If you please
I'll stay here—where I know,

And the flowers grow.''

In another vein is the bright little “Child‘s
Song‘':-—

The King and the Queen were riding

Upon a Summer's day,
And a Blackbird flew above them,
To hear what they did say.

The King said he liked apples,
The Queen said she liked pears ;
And what shall we do to the Blackbird

Who listens unawares?

But, as a rule, it must be admitted of her poetry
that, while nearly always poetic in its impulse, it is
often halting and inarticulate in its expression.
