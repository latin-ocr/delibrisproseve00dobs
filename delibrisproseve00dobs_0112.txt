“green covers'' of Dickens. Years later, the
assumed narrator of Cranford visits Miss Jenkyns‚
then falling into senility. She still vaunts lee
Rambler; still maunders vaguely of the “strange
old book, with the queer name, poor Captain Brown
was killed for reading—that book by ΜΓ. Boz, you
know—Old P0z3 when I was a girl—but that’s a
long time ago—I acted Lucy in Old Poz.‘' There
can be no mistake. Lucy is the justice‘s daughter
in Miss Edgeworth's little chamber-drama.
