PROLOGUE

LECTOR BENEVOLE J—FOR SO

THEY USED TO CALL YOU, YEARS AGO,—-

1 CAN'T PRETEND TO MAKE YOU READ

THE PAGES THAT TO THIS SUCCEED5

NOR COULD I—IF Ι WOULD—-EXCUSE

THE WAYWARD PROMPTINGS OF THE MUSE
AT WHOSE COMMAND I WROTE THEM DOWN.

I HAVE ΝΟ ΗΟΡΕ ΤΟ “ΡῙ.,ΕΑ8Ε THE TOWN.’'

I DID BUT THINK SOME FRIENDLY SOUL

(NOT [LL-ADVISED, UPON THE WHOLE 1)

MIGHT LIKE THEM5 AND ‘· TO INTERPOSE

A LITTLE EASE‚'' BETWEEN THE PROSE,
SLIPPED IN THE SCRAPS OF VERSE, THAT THUS
THINGS MIGHT BE LESS MONOTONOUS.

THEN, LECTOR, BE BENEVOLUS!
