 

THE PARENT’S ASSISTA NT

ΟΝΕ of the things that perplexes the dreamer—-for‚
in spite of the realists‚ there are dreamers still—is the
almost complete extinction of the early editions of
certain popular works. The pompous, respectable,
full-wigged sonos, with their long lists of subscribers,
and their magniloquent dedications, find their
permanent abiding-places in noblemen’s collections‚
where, unless—with the Chrysostom in Pope’s verses—-
they are used for the smoothing of bands or the press-
ing of flowers, no one ever disturbs their drowsy
diuturnity. Their bulk makes them sacred : like the
regimental big drum, they are too large to be mis-
laid. But where are all the first copies of that little
octavo of 246 pages, price eigffleenpence, “Printed
by T. Maxey for Rich. Marriot‚ in S. Dunstans
Church—yard, Fleetstreet '’ in 1653, which constitutes
the editio princeps of Walton‘s Angler. Probably
they were worn out in the pockets of Honest Izaak's
“ brothers of the Angle,'' or left to bake and cockle

in the sunny corners of wasp-haunted alehouse windows‚
