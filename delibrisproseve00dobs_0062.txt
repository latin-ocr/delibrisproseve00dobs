To make this a peg for a dissertation on the jars
of lettuce and fennel grown by the Greeks for the
annual Adonis festivals, is needless. But it may be
noted that Bramston, with those of his day,—Swift
excepted‚-scans the “ ο ” in balcony long, a practice
which continued far into the nineteenth century.
“Centemplate,'’ said Rogers‚ “is bad enough; but
balcbny makes me sick.'' ¹ And even in 1857, two
years after Rogers’s death, the late F rederick Locker‚
writing of Piccadilly, speaks of “Old Q‘s'’ well-
known Window in that thoroughfare as “Primrose
balcony.’'
