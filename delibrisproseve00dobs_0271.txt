CRoss READINGS 2 1 7

The lines—there are twenty-eight of them—
speak of Whitefoord as, among other things, a

Rare compound of oddiry, frolic and fun Β

Who relish'd a joke‚ and rejoic'd in a pun 3¹
Whose temper was genetoris, open, sincere ;

A stranger to flatt'ry‚ a stranger to sear ;

Who scatter'd around wit and humour at will,
Whose daily bom mets half a column would fill ;
A Scotchman‚ from pride and from prejudice free,
A scholar, yet surely no pedant was he.

What psty, alas l that so lib’ral a mind

Should so long be to news-paper-essays confin'd !
Who perhaps to the summit of science could soar,
Yet content “if the table he set on a roar '’ ;
Whose talents to fill any station were fit,

Yet happy if Woodfizll confess’d him a wit.

The “ servile herd '' of “ tame imitators ’'—the
“ news-paper witlings ’' and “ pert scribbling folks''——
were further requested to visit his tomb—
To deck it, bring with you festoons of the vine,
And copious libations bestow on his shrine 3

Then strew all around it (you can do no less)
Crass-readings, Ship-nezw, and Mistakes of the Press.

lt is not recorded that Kearsly ever saw this in
Goldsmith‘s “ own handwriting ”3 the sender's name
has never been made known 3 and—as above observed

¹ “Mr. W.''—says a note to the fifth edition—“is so notorious a punster‚
that Doctor Goldsmith used to say, it was impossible to keep him company,
without being iaeqf'ected with the itclz of punning.” Yet Johnson endured him, and
apparently liked him, though he had the additional disqualification of being a
North Briton.
