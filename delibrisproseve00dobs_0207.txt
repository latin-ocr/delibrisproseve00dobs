A FRENCH CRITIC ΟΝ ΒΑΤΗ 157

Memoir53 to the days when hapless Catherine of
Braganza, with the baleful “belle Stewart'' in her
tram, made fruitless pilgrimage to Bladud's spring as
a remedy against sterility. He sketches‚ with due
acknowledgments to Goldsmith's unique little book,
the biography of that archquack, poseur‚ and very
elever organiser, Mr. Richard Nash, the first real
Master of the Ceremonies3 and he gives a full
account of his followers and successors. He also
minutely relates the story of Sheridan's marriage to
his beautiful “St. Cecilia,’' Elizabeth Ann Linley.
A separate and very interesting chapter is allotted to
Lady Huntingdon and the Methodists, not without
levies from the remarkable Spiritual Quixote of that
Rev. Richard Graves of Claverton, of whom an
excellent account was given not long since in Mr.
W. H. Hutton's suggestive Burford Papers. Other
chapters are occupied With Bath and its belles lettres ;
with “Squire Allworthy'’ of Prior Park and his
literary guestS, Pope, Warburton, Fielding and his
sister, etc.; with the historic Frascati vase of Lady
Miller at Batheaston, which stirred the ridicule of
Horace Walpole‚ and is still, it is said, to be seen in

unusually good one‚—he makes no reference to Evelyn's visit to Bath. But
Evelyn went there in June, 1654, bathed in the Cross Rath, criticis-ed the
“sacciula'’ of the Abbey Church, complained of the “narrow, uneven and
unpleasant streetS,'' and inter-visited with the company frequenting the place
for health. “Among the rest of the idle diversions of the town‚'' hc says,
“one musician was famous for acting a changeling [idiot or half-wit} which
indeed he personated strangely.'’ (Diaty‚ Globe edn„ 1908, p. 174.)
