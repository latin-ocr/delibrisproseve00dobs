FRESH FACTS ABoUT FIELDING 197

the disappointed lover (one is sure he was never
an heiress-hunter l) was despatched to the Dutch
University to keep him out of mischief.l But in
once more examining Mr. Keightley’s posthumous
papers‚ kindly placed at my disposal by his nephew,
Mr. Alfi-ed C. Lyster, Ι found a reference to an
un-noted article in the Cornlzill Magazz'ne for
November, 1863 (from internal evidence I believe it
to have been written by James Hannay)‚ entitled
“ A Scotchman in Holland.'‘ Visiting Leyden, the
writer was permitted to inspect the University
Album; and he found, under 1728, the following 1——
“Henricus Fielding, Anglus, Ann. 20. Stud. Lit.'',
coupled with the further detail that he “ was living
at the ‘ Hotel of Antwerp.' '' Except in the item of
“ Stud. Lit.''‚ this did not seem to conflict materially
with Murphy's account, as Fielding was nominally
twenty from 1727 to 1728, and small discrepancies

must be allowed for.
Twenty years later, a fresh version of the record

came to light. At their tercentenary festival in
187 5, the Leyden University printed a list of their
students from their foundation to that year. From
this Mr. Edward Peacock, F.S.A.‚ compiled in 1883,
for the Index Society‚ an Index to English-Speaking
Students wlzo lzave graduated at Leyden University3
and at p. 35 appears Fz’dding, Henricus, Anglus, 16
