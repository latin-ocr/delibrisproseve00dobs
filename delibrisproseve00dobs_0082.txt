“La peinture ῖι l‘lzuile, C'est bien difficile3 Mais
c'est beaucoup plus beau Que la peinture ὰ l'eau.''
About la peinture ὰ l'eau, M. Rouquet says very little,
in all probability because the English Water Colour
School, which, with the advance of topographic art,
grew so rapidly in the second half of the century,
was yet to come. He refers, however, with approval
to the gouaclzes of Joseph Goupy‚ Lady Burlington’s
drawing-master, perhaps better known to posterity
by his (or her ladyship's) caricature of Handel as the
“Charming Brute.’' (Caricature‚ by the way, is a
branch of Georgian Art which M. Rouquet neglects.)
As regards landscape and animal painting, he ‘⁶ abides
in generalities’'; but he must have been acquainted
with the sea pieces of Monamy‚ and Hogarth's and
Walpole‘s friend Samuel Scott3 and should, one
would think, have known of the horses and dogs ot
VVootton and Seymour. Upon Enamel he might be
expected to enlarge, although he mentions but one
master, his own model, Zincke, who carried the art
of portrait in this way much farther than any
predecessor. Moreover, like Petitot, he made dis—
coveries which he was wise enough to keep to himself.

² He died in 1749.
