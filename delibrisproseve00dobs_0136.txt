A few words may be added in regard to the mere
facts of Miss Greenaway's career. She was born at
1 Cavendish Street, Hoxton, on the 17th March, 1846,
her father being Mr. John Greenaway, a draughts-
man on wood, who contributed much to the earlier
issues of the Illustrated London News and Punclz.
Annual visits to a farm-house at Rolleston in
Nottinghamshire—the country residence already re—
ferred to——nourished and confirmed her love of
nature. Very early she showed a distinct bias towards
colour and design of an original kind. She studied
at different places, and at South Kensington. Here
both she and Lady Butler “would bribe the porter
to lock them in when the day's work was done, so
that they might labour on for some while more.''
Her master at Kensington was Richard Burchett‚
who, forty years ago, was a prominent figure in the
art-schools, a well instructed painter‚ and a teacher
exceptionally equipped with all the learning of his
craft. Mr. Burchett thought highly of Miss Green-
away's abilities ; and she worked under him for several
years with exemplary perseverance and industry.
She subsequently studied in the Slade School under
Professor LegrOS.

Her first essays in the way of design took the
form of Christmas cards, then beginning their now
somewhat flagging career, and she exhibited pictures
at the Dudley Gallery for some years in succession‚
