Or mark with what unwearied strength you wear
The weight that WARTON found too great to bear.¹
There is no need for this or that. My plan

Is less to laud the Matter than the Man.

This is my brief. We recognise in you

The mind judicial, the untroubled view 3

The critic who, without pedantic pose,

Takes his firm foothold on the thing he knows ;
Who, free alike from passion or pretence,

Holds the good rule of calm and common sense ;
And be the subject or perplexed or plain,—
Clear or confusing,-—is throughout urbane,
Patient, pemuasive, logical, precise,

And only hard to vanity and vice.

More Ι could add, but brevity is best 3-—

These are our claims to honour you as Guest.
