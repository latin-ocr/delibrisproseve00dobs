THE FRIEND OF HUMANITY AND THE
RHYMER

“ Emam tua carmina sanus ?'’—M AAAAAAA

F. oF H. I WANT a verse. It gives you little pains 3—
You just sit down, and draw upon your
hrains.
Come, now, be amiable.

R. To hear you talk,
You'd make it easier to fly than walk.
You seem to think that rhyming is a thing
You can produce if you but touch a

spring 3
That fancy, fervour, passion—and what
not,
Are just a case of “ penny in the slot.''
You should reflect that no evasive bird
Is half so shy as is your fittest word ;
And even similes, however wrought,
Like hares, before you cook them, must be
caught 3——
Impromptus, tOO, require elaboration,
