216 DE LIBRIS

“ most distinguished Wits of the Metropolis,'' who,
following Garrick's lead in 1774, diverted them—
selves at the St. James's Coffee—house hy composing
the epitaphs on Goldsmith which gave rise to the
incomparable gallery entitled Remliasion. In the
first four editions of that posthumons poem there is
no mention of Whitefoord, who, either at, or soon
after the first meeting above referred to, had written
an epitaph on Goldsmith, two-thirds of which are
declared to be “unfit for publicati0n.'‘1 But when
the fourth edition of Rclczlialion had been printed, an
epitaph on VVhitefoord was forwarded to the pub-
lisher, George Kearsly, by “a friend of the late
Doctor Goldsmith,'' with an intimation that it was

a transcript of an original in “the Doctor's own

handwriting.'’ “It is a striking proof of Doctor
Goldsmith's good-nature,'' said the sender, ghmcing,

we may suppose, at Whitefoord's performance. “I
saw this sheet of papei· in the Doctor‘s room, five
or six days before he died ; and, as I had got all the
other Epitaphs, I asked him ifI might take it. “ ln
trutlz you may, my Boy (replied he), for it will be of
no use to me where J am going.''
