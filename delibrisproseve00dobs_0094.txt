And (unlike eggs) grow fresh by incuba-

tion ;

Then‚—-as to epigrams . . .

Nay, nay, I've done.
I did but make petition. You make fun.

Stay. I am grave. Forgive me if I
ramble :

But, then, a negative needs some preamble

To break the blow. I feel with you, in
truth‚

These complex miseries of Age and Youth ;

I feel with you—and none can feel it more

Than I—-this burning Problem of the
Poor 3

The VVant that grinds, the Mystery of Pain,

The Hearts that sink, and never rise
again ;—

How shall I set this to some careless screed,

Or jigg‘mg stave‚ When Help is what you
need,

Hesp, Help,—-more Help ?

Ι fancied that with ease
You'd scribble off some verses that might
please,

And so give help to us.

Why then—TAKF. THESE !
