BOOKS AND THEIR ASSOCIATIONS 7

carp and pike, must probably have referred. He
often mentions “ Sir Francis Bacon’s '’ History of Life
and Deaffz, which is included in the volume. No
doubt it would be more reasonable and more “ con-
gruous“ that Bacon’s book should suggest Bacon.
But there it is. That illogical “ succession of ideas ’'
which puzzled my Uncle Toby, invariably recalls to
me, not the imposing folio to be purchased “next to
the Mytre Tauerne’' in Fleet Street, but the un-
pretentious eighteenpenny octavo which, two years
later, was on sale at Richard Marriot's in St.
Dunstan's churchyard hard by, and did no more than
borrow its erudition from the riches of the Baconian
storehouse.

Life, and its prolongation, is again the theme
of the next book (also mentioned, by the way, in
Walton) which Ι take up, though unhappily it has no
inscription. It is a little old calf-clad copy of Lewis
Cornaro’s Sure and Certain Methods of attaining a
Long and Healllzful Life, 4th ed., 24mo, 1727 ; and
was bought at the Bewick sale of February, 1884, as
having once belonged to Robert Elliot Bewick, only
son of the famous old Newcastle wood—engraver.
As will be shown later, it is easy to be misled in these
matters, but I cannot help believing that this volume,
which looks as if it had been re-bound, is the one
Thomas Bewick mentions in his Memoir as having
been his companion in those speculative wanderings
