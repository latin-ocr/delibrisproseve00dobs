to meditate upon your next excursion to THE BATH,
provided always that you have not dipped your estate
at “ E.O.”, or been ruined by millincrs' bills 3—that
your son has not gone northwards with a sham Scotch
heiress, or your daughter been married at Charlcombe,
by private license, to a pinchbeck Irish peer. For all
these things—however painful the adniission—were,
according to the most credible chroniclers‚ the by-no-
means infrequent accompaniment or seque] of an
unguarded sojourn at the old jigging, card-playing‚
scandal-loving, pleasure-seeking city in the loop of
“ the soft-flowing Avon.''

It is an inordinate paragraph, outraging all known
rules of composition! But then—How seductive a
subject is eighteenth-century Bath l—and how rich in
memories is M. Barbeau's book!
