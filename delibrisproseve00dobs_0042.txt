DE LIBRIS

Shrink down, fade out, and sans preferment‚
Depart to their obscure interment 3-—

We should be pardon'd if we doubt

That a new venture can hold out.

It will, you say. Then don't be “ new '' ;
Be “ old.'’ The Old is still the True.
Nature (said GAUTIER) never tries

To alter her accustom'd dye83

And all your novelties at best

Are ancient puppets, nery drest.

What you must do, is not to shrink
From speaking out the thing you think 3
And blaming where ’tis right to blame,
Despite tradition and a Name.

Yet don't expand a trifling blot,

Or ban the book for What it's not

(That is the poor device of those

Who cavil where they can’t oppose Ι) ;
Moreover (this is very old l),

Be courteous—even When you scold !

Blame I put first, but not at heart,

You must give Praise the foremost part 3-
Praise that to those Who write is breath

Of Life, ifjust3 if unjust, Death.

Praise then the things that men revere ;
Praise what they love, not what they fear 3
