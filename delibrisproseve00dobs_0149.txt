TWO MODERN BOOK ILLUSTRATORS

ΙΙ. MR HUGH THOMSON

ΙΝ virtue of certain gentle and caressing qualities of
style, Douglas Jerrold conferred on one of his con-
tributors—Miss Eliza Meteyard—the pseudonym
of “Silverpe11.’' It is in the silver-pensive key
that one would wish to write of Mr. HUGH
THOMSON. There is nothing in his work of
elemental strife,—of social problem,—of passion
torn to tatters. He leads you by no terribile via,
—over no “burning Marle.'’ You cannot conceive
him as the illustrator of Parczdise Lost, of Dante's
Inferno-——even of Dore’s Wandering Jew. But
when, after turning over some dozens of his
designs, you take stock of your impressions, you
discover that your memory is packed with pleasant
fancies. You have been among “ blown fields ’' and
“flowerful closes''; you have passed quaint road-
side-inns and picturesque cottages; you are familiar

with the cheery, ever-changing idyll of the highway
