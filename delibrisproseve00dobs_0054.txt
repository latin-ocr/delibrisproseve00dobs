30 DE LIBRIS

unabashed mouthpiece of his own fatuity. “ Mine,''
say the concluding lines,—

Mine are the gallant Schcmes of Politesse‚
For books, and buildings, politicks‚ and dress.
This is True Yam, and whoso likcs it not,
Is blockhead, coxcomb, puppy, fool, and sot.

One is insensibly reminded of a quotation from P. L.
Courier‚ made in the Cornltz'll many years since by
the once famous “Jacob Omnium '’ when replying
controversially to the author of Ionica. “Je vois ’'—
says Courier, after recapitulating a string of abusive
epithets hurled at him by his opponent—“je vois ce
qu’il veut dire: il entend que lui et moi sont d'avis
dffrent; et c'est ἰὰ sa mambre de s’exprimer.’' It was
also the manner of our Man of Taste.

The second line of the above quotation from
Bramston gives us four of the things upon which his
hero lays down the law. Let us see what he says
about literature. As a professing critic he prefers
books with notes :--

Tho' Blaskmore’s works my soul with raptures fill,
With notes by Bently they‘d be better still.

Swift he detests-not of course for detestable qualities,
but because he is so universally admired. In poetry
he holds by rhyme as opposed to blank verse :-——

Verse without rhyme I never could endure,
Uncouth in numbers, and in sense obscure.
