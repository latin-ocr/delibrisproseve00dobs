CROSS READINGS 2 1 9

Pieces have generally succeeded beyond my most
sanguine Expectations, altho' they were not season'd
with private Scandal or persona] Abuse, of which
our good neighbours of South Britain are realy
too fond.” In Debrett's New Foundling Hospital
for Wit‚ new edition, 1784, there are several of his
productions, including 3 letter to Woodfall “On
the Errors of the Press‚‘' of which the following
may serve as 3 sample: “I have known you turn 3
11131161 of hearsay, into 3 matter of heresy3 Damon
into 3 daemon 3 a delicious girl, into a delirious girl3
the comic muse, into a comic mouse3 a Jewish
Rabbi, into 3 Jewish Rabbit3 and when 3 60116-
spondent, lamenting the corruption of the times,
exclaimed ‘O Moresl' you made him cry, ‘O
Moses!’'‘ And here is 311 extract from another
paper which explains the aforegoing reference to
“horse Races‘': “1763—Spring Meeting. . . Mr.
Wilkes's horse, LIBERTY, rode by himself, took the
lead at starting3 but being pushed hard by Mr.
Bishop's black gelding, PRIVJLEGE, fell down at the
Devil's Ditch, and was no where.'' The “Ship
News '’ is on the same pattern. “ August 25 [1765]
We hear that his Majesty's Ship Newcastle will soon
have a new figure-head, the old one being almost
worn out.''
