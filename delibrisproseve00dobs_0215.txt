A WELCOME FROM THE
“JOHNSON CLUB“

To William John Courffiope, Mat-cll 12, 1903

WHEN PopE carne back from Trojan wars once more,
He found a Bard, to meet him on the shore,

And hail his advent with a strain as clear

As e'er was sung by BYRON or by FRERE.1

You, SIR, have travelled from no distant clime,

Yet would JOHN GAY could welcome you in rhyme ς
And by some fable not too coldly penned,

Teach how with judgment one may praise a Friend.

There is no need that I should tell in words
Your prowess from lee Paradise of Birds ; 2

No need to show how surely you have traced
The Life in Poetry, the Law in Taste ; 3
