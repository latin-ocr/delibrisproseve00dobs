Or watch the Comus Crew
Sweep down the Glade ; or view
Strange-streamer‘d Craft from Javan or Gadire !

Or could we catch once more,
High up, the Clang and Roar
Of Ange] Conflict‚—Angel Overthrow ;
Or, with a World begun,
Behold the young-ray'd Sun
Flame in the Groves where the Four Rivers go l

F oretells of Tempest in the Days to come 3
Nowhere is heard up-climb
The lofty lyric Rhyme‚
And the “ God-gifted Organ-voice '' is dumb}
