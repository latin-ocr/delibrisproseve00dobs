BRAMSTON'S “MAN OF TASTE“ 31

In this the Man of Taste is obviously following the
reigning fashion. But if we may assume Bramston
himself to approve what his hero condemns, he must

closely couched in measure-keeping Posie, ‹larts it selfe forth more furiously, and
wounds me even to the quicke '’ (Essayes, bk. i. ch. xxv. (Florio's translation).
