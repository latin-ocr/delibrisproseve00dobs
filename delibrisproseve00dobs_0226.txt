as we are credibly informed, should have been before
committed to paper.1

When Esmond first made its appearance in October
1852, it was not without distinguished and even
formidable competitors. Bleak House had reached
its eighth number3 and Bulwer was running My
Novel in Blackwood. In Fraser, Kingsley was bring-
ing out Hypatia ; and Whyte Melville was preluding
with Digby Grand. Charlotte Bronte must have
been getting ready Villette for the press3 and
Tennyson—undeterred by the fact that his hero had
already been “ dirged '' by the indefatigable Tupper—
was busy with his Ode on tlze Decctlz of tlze Duke of
Wellington.2 The critics of the time were possibly
embarrassed with this wealth of talent, for they were
not, “at the outset‚ immoderately enthusiastic over
the new arrival. The Athenaeum was by no means
laudatory. Esmond “ harped upon the same string '' ;
“wanted vital heat'’; “touched no fresh fount of
thought'’; “introduced no novel forms of life'’;

1 “The sentences''—-Mr. Crowe told a member of the Afficnaeurn, when
speaking of his task—-“came out glibly as he [Thackeray] paced the room.''
This is the more singular when contrasted with the slow elaboration of the
Balzac and Flaubert school. No doubt Thackeray must often have arranged in
his mind precisely much that he meant to say. Such seems indeed to have been
his habit. The late Mr. Locker-Lampson informed the writer of this paper
that once, when he met the author of Esmond in the Green Park, Thackeray
gently begged to be allowed to wall< alone, as he had some verses in his head
which he was finishing. They were those which afterwards appeared in the
Cornhill for January 1867, under the title of Mrs. Katherine’s Lantern.

2 The Duke died 14th Sept. 1852.
