speak of Whitefoord as, among other thingS, a

Who relish'd a joke, and rcjoic’d 111 a pun 31
Whose temper was generoUS, open, sincere 3

Α stranger 10 11311Τγ, a stranger to sear 3

Who scatter'd around wit and humour at will,
Whose daily bom mets half a column would fil] ;
A Scotchman‚ from pride and from prejudice free,
Α scholar, yet surely 110 pedam was he.

Should so long be to news—paper-essays confin'd 1
Who perhaps 10 the summit of science could soar,
Yet content “if the table he set 011 a roar '' ;
Whose talents to fill any station were fit,

Yet happy if ls'oozffilll confess’d him a wit.

And copious libations bestow on his shrine ;

Then strew all around 11 (you can do 110 less)
Crass-readings, Skip-nsfosg aud ltljstakm· of the Pras.
