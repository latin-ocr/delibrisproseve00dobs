it, practical education,—and long before this date,
as early, indeed, as May 1780, he had desired his
daughter, while she was still a girl at a London school,
to write him a tale about the length of a Spectator,
upon the topic of “Generosity,'' to be taken from
history or romance. This was her first essay in
fiction ; and it was pronounced by the judge to whom
it was submitted,—in competition with a rival pro-

somewhat damaging inquiry‚—“But where's the
Generosity?” The question cannot be answered
