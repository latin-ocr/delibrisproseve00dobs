not a bird—this wiseacre acquaints us. Had the
gifted author of Lyrics of tlte Heart never heard of
rhetorical figures? But he is not Goldsmith's only
hyper-critic. Charles Fox, who admired The Traveller,
thought Olivia's famous song in the Vicar “ foolish,''
and added that “ folly '' was a bad rhyme to “ melan--
choly.’' ¹ He must have forgotten Milton's :-—

Bird that shunn’st the noise of folly,
Most musicam, most melancholy !

Or he might have gone to the other camp, and
remembered Pope on Mrs, Howard :—

Not warp’d by passion, aw’d by Rumour,
Not grave thro' pride, or gay thro' F011y‚
An equal Mixture of good Humour,
And sensible soft Melancholy.
