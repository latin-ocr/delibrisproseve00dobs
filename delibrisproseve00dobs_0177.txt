HORATIAN ODE
ΟΝ THE TERCENTENARY OF
“DON QUIXOTE'‘

(Publislzed at Madrid, ΙΨ francisco de Robles, Janumy 160 5)

*⁴ Para mi sola naci& don Quixote‚ y yo para el.''—-CF.RVANTES.

ADVENTS We greet of great and small 3
Much We extol that may not live ;
Yet to the new-born Type we give

No care at all ἱ

This year,¹—three centuries past,—by age
More maimed than by LEPANTO’S sight,—
This year CERVANTES gave to light

His matchless page,

Whence first outrode th' immortal Pais,—
The half-crazed Hero and his hind,—
To make sad laughter for mankind ;
And whence they fare

¹ Le. January 1905.
