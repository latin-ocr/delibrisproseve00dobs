and distinction,——what has been rightly described
as a “ splendid work'' on Burns ;1 while M. Emile
Legouis, in a minute examination of ‘⁶ The Prelude‚''
has contrasted and compared the orthodox Words-
worth of maturity with the juvenile semi-atheist of
Coleridge. Travelling farther afield, M. W. Thomas
has devoted an exhaustive volume to Young of
the Niglzt leouglz253 M. Le'on Morel, another to
Thomson3 and, incidentally, a flood of fresh light
has been thrown upon the birth and growth of
the English Novel by the admirable Jean-Jacques
Rousseau et les Origines du Cosmopolitisme Litteraire
of the late Joseph Texte—an investigation un-
questionably of the ripest scholarship‚ and the most
extended research. And now once more there are
signs that French lucidity and French precision
are about to enter upon other conquests; and
we have M. Barbeau's study of a famous old
English watering-place 2 —— appropriately dedicated,
as is another of the books already mentioned, to
M. Beljame.³ “

1 A volume of Pages Choisies de Auguste Angellier‚ Prose et Vers, with an
Introduction by M. Legouis, has recently (1908) been issued by the Clarendon
Press. It contains lengthy extracts from M. Angellier's study of Burns.

Litte'raire ὰ Batlz sous la Reine Anne et sous les Georges. Par A. Barbeau. Paris,
Picard‚ 1904.

3 The list grows apace. To the above, among others, must now be added
M. Rene' Huchon’s brilliant little essay on Mrs. Montagu, and his elaborate
study of Crabbe, to say nothing of M. Jules Derocquigny's Lamb, M. Jules
Douady's Hazlitt‚ and M. Joseph Aynard's Coleridge.
