A FRENCH CRITIC ΟΝ ΒΑΤΗ

AMONG other pleasant premonitions of the present
emente cordiale between France and England is the
increased attention which, for some time past, our
friends of Outre Manche have been devoting to our
literature. That this is wholly of recent growth, is
not, of course, to be inferred. It must be nearly
five-and-forty years since M. Hippolyte Taine issued
his logical and orderly Histoire de la Litte'rature
Anglaise; while other isolated efforts of insight and
importance—such as the Laurence Sterne of M. Paul
Stapfer‚ and the excellent Le Public et les Hommes de
Lettres en Angleterre au XVIIF Sibcle of the late
M. Alexandre Beljame of the Sorbonne--are already
of distant date. But during the last two decades the
appearance of similar productioris has been more
recurrent and more marked. From one eminent
writer alone—M. J—J. Jusserand—We have received
an entire series of studies of exceptional charm,
variety, and accomplishment. M. Felix Rabbe has
given us a sympathetic analysis of Shelley3 M.
