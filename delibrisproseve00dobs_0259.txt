THE HAPPY PRINTER

“ Hoc est vivere.’'—MART1AL.

THE Printer's is a happy lot:
Alone of all professions,

No fateful smudges ever blot
His earliest “ impressions.''

The outgrowth of his youthful ken
No cold obstruction fetters ;

He quickly learns the “ types '' of men,
And all the world of “ letters.''

With “ forms '’ he scorns to compromise ;
For him no “ rule '’ has terrors ;

The “ slips '' he makes he can “ revise ’'—-
They are but “ printers' errors.''

From doubtful questions of the “ Press '’
He wisely holds aloof 3
In all polemics, more or less,

His argument is “ proof.’'
