yielded, no doubt, to pressure put upon her to try
figures on a larger scale3 to illustrate books, which
was not her strong point, as it only put fetters upon
her fancy; but, in the main, she courageously pre-
served the even tenor of her way, which was to
people the artistic demesne she administered with
the tiny figures which no one else could make more
captivating, or clothe more adroitly. It may be
doubted whether the collector will set much store
by Bret Harte‘s Quem of the Pirate [sle or the Pied
Piper of Hamelin, suitable at first sight as is the
latter, with its child-element, to her inventive
idiosyncrasy. But he will revel in the dainty scenes
of “Almanacks'' (1883 to 1895, and 1897); in
the charming Birthday Book of 18803 in Mother
Goose, A Day in a Child’s Life, Little Ann, Marigold
Garden and the rest, of which the grace is perennial,
though the popularity for the moment may have

waned.
