are few traces of them. There is a quarto copy of
the unfortunate Columbus, with Stothard's sketches;
and there is the choice little Pleasures of Memory

to Hayward, once at breakfast, when some one quoted
Gray's irresponsible outburst concerning the novels

himself confesses to have read through six times,
and which French critics still hold, on inconclusive
evidence, to have been the “only begetter'' of
Richardson's Pamela and the sentimental novel.
None of the trio knew anything about it. “Then
I will lend you each a copy,'' rejoined Rogers; and
the volumes were immediately produced, doubtless

Paine, of whom his master was wont to affirm that
he would not only find any book in the house,
but out of it as well. What is more (unless it be

at least, of the three copies must have been returned,
