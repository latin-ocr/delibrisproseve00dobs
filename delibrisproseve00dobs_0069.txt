M. ROUQUET ΟΝ THE ARTs

M. RouQuET‘s book is a rare duodecimo of some
two hundred pages, bound in sheep, which, in the
copy before us, has reached that particular stage
of disintegration when the scarfskin, without much
persuasion, peels away in long strips, Its title is—
L'Etczt des Arts, en Angleterre. Par M. Rouquet, de
l'Acade'mie Royale de Peinture & de Sculpture; and
it is “ imprime' ὰ Paris,‘' though it was to be obtained
from John Nourse, “ Libraire dans le Strand, proebe
Temple—barr''—a well—known importer of foreign
books, and one of Henry Fielding's publishers. The
date is 1755, being the twenty—eighth year of the
reign of His Majesty King George the Second—a
reign not generally regarded as favourable to art
of any kind. In what month of 1755 the little
volume was first put forth does not appear3 but it
must have been before October, when Nourse issued
an English version. There is a dedication, in the
approved French fashion, to the Marquis de Marigny,
“Directeur & Ordonnaseur Ge'ne'ral de ses Batimens,

Jardins, Arts, Acadbmies {9³ Manufczctures '' to Lewis
