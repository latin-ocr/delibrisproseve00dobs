THE PASSIONATE PRINTER TO
HIS LOVE

(leose name is Amanda.)

With Apologies to the Shade of Christopher NIarlowe.

CoME live with me and be my Dear ;
And till that happy bond shall lapse,
I'll set your Poutings in Brevier,1

Your Praises in the largest CAPS.

There’s Diamond—'tis for your Eyes ;
There's Ruby-that will match your Lips 3

Pearl‚ for your Teeth ; and Minion—size
To suit your dainty Finges-tips.

In Nonparez'l I’ll put your Face ;
In Rubric shall your Blushes rise 3
There is no Bourgeois in your Case ;
Your Form can never need “ Revise.'‘

Your Cheek seems “ Ready for tlte Press '’ ;
Your Laugh as Clarendon is clear ;

There's more distinction in your Dress
Than in the oldest Elzevir.
