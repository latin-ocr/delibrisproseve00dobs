Ramsay and the younger Vanloo (Jean Baptiste).
Both were no doubt far above their predecessors;
but Ramsay would specially appeal to Rouquet by
his continental training‚ and Vanloo by his French
manner and the superior variety of his attitudes.1
The only other name Rouquet recalls is that of
the drapery-painter Joseph Vanhaken3 and we
suspect it is to Rouquet that we owe the pleasant
anecdote of the two painters who, for the sum of
g8oo a year, pre-empted his exclusive and inestimable
services, to the wholesale discomfiture of their brethren
of the brush. The rest shall be told in Rouquet's
words :—“ The best [artists] were no longer able to
paint a hand, a coat, a background ; they were forced
to learn, which meant additional labour—what a
misfortune! Henceforth there arrived no more to
Vanhaken from different quarters of London, nor by
coach from the most remote towns of England‚
canvases of all sizes, where one or more heads were
painted, under which the painter who forwarded
them had been careful to add, pleasantly enough, the

¹ Another French writer, the Abbe' le. Blanc, gives a ‹lepressing account of
English portraits before Vanloo came to England : “ At some distance one might
easily mistake a dozen of them for twelve copies of the same original. Some
have the head turned to the left, others to the right 3 and this is the most sensible
difference to be observed between them. Moreover, excepting the face, you find
in all the same neck, the same arms, the sume flesh, the same attitude3 and to
say all, you observe no more life than ‹lesign in those pretended portraits.
Properly speaking, they [the artists] are not painters, they know how to lay
colours on the canvas 5 but they know not how to animate it '’ (Letters on the

English and Frenclz Nariom, 1747, i. 160).
