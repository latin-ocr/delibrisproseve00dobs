Colley Cibber, who, however, deserves the laurel he
wears‚ not for 'l'lze Careless Husband, his best comedy,
but for his Epilogues and other Plays.

It pleases me, that Pope unlaurcll'd gom,
While Cibber wears the Bays for Play-housc Prose.
So Britain’s Monarch once uncover'd sate,

While Bradskaw bully'd in a broad-brimmed hat,—

a reminiscence of King Charles’s trial which might
have been added to Bramston stock quotations. The
productions of “Curll's chaste press” are also this
connoisseur's favourite reading‚—the lives of players
in particular, probably on the now obsolete grounds
set forth in Carlyle’s essay on Scott.1 Among these
the memoirs of Cibber’s “Lady Betty Modish,’'
Mrs. Oldfield, then lately dead, and buried in
VVestminster Abbey‚ are not obscurely indicated.

In morals our friend—as might be expected circa
1730—is a Freethinker and Deist. Tindal is his
text—book : his breviary the Fable of tlze Bees :—

T' improve in lssorals Mandez'ill read,

And '‘Tyndal’s Scruples are my settled Creed.
Ι travell'd early, and Ι soon saw through
Religion all, e'er I was twenty-two.

Shame, Pain, or Poverty shall Ι endum,
When ropes or opium can my ease procure?
When money’s gone, and I no debts can pay,
Self-murder is an honourable way.

¹ ‘⁴ It has been said, ‘ There are no English lives worth reading except those of
Players, who by the nature of the case have bidden Respectability good-day.'''
