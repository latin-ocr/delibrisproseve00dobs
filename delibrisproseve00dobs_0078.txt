letter of five years earlier on the “ March to Finchley.'’
To return, however, to History Painting. Accord—
ing to Rouquet, its leading exponent¹ under George
the Second was Francis Hayman of the “large noses
and shambling legs,'' now known chiefly as a crony
of Hogarth, and a facile but ineffectual illustrator of
Shakespeare and Cervantes. In 1754, however, his
pictures of See-Save), Hot Cockles, Blind Man's Buffi
and the like, for the supper-boxes at Vauxhall
Gardens, with Sayer's prints therefrom, had made his
name familiar, although he had not yet painted those
more elaborate compositions in the large room next
the rotunda, over which Fanny Burney's “ Holborn
Beau,'‘ Mr. Smith, comes to such terrible grief in
ch. xlvi. of Evelina. But he had contributed a
“ Finding of Moses '' to the New Foundling Hospital,
which is still to be seen in the Court Room there,
in company with three other pictures executed con—
currently for the remaining compartments, Joseph
Highmore's “Hagar and Ishmael,'' James Wills's
“suffer little Children,'' and Hogarth's “Moses
brought to Pharaoh’s Daughter'’—the best of the
four, as well as the most successful of Hogarth’s
historical pieces. All these, then recently installed,
are mentioned by Rouquet.

¹ This is confirmed by Arthur Murphy: ‘¹ Every Thing is put out of Hand
by this excellent Artist with the utmost Grace and Delicacy, and his History-
Pieces have, besides their beautiful Colouring, the most lively Expression of
Character '⁷ (Grass Irm Journal, February 9, 1754).
