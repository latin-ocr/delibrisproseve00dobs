FRESH FACTS ABOUT FIELDING 203

The first three, With Sarah, make up the “Four
Worthy Sisters ” of the reprehensible author of that
“ truly coarse—titled Tam Jones,'’ concerning which
Richardson wrote shudderingly in August 1749 to
his young friends, Astraea and Minerva Hill. The
final entry relating to Fielding's little daughter,
Louisa, born December 3rd, 17 52, makes it probable
that, in May, 1753, he was staying in the house at
Hammersmith‚ then occupied by his sole surviving
sister, Sarah. In the following year (October 8th)
he himself died at Lisbon. There is no better short
appreciation of his work than Lowell's lapidary
lines for the Shire Hall at Taunton‚—the epigraph
to the bust by Miss Margaret Thomas :

He looked on naked nature unashamed‚
And saw the Sphinx, now bestiast, now divine,

In change and re—change ; he nor praised nor blamed,
But drew her as he saw with fearless 11116.

Did he good service ? God must judge, not we 1
Manly he was, and generous and sincere ;

English in all, of genius blithely free :
Who loves a Man may see his image here.
