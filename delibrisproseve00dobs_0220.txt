his greatest work in its particular kind, for its sequel,
lee Vz'rginiczns, however admirable in detached
passages, is desultory and invertebrate,'while Denis
Duval, of which the promise was rgreat, remains
unfinished. With Vanity Fair, the author's master-
piece in another manner, Esmond cannot properly
be compared, because an imitation of the past can
never compete in verisimilitude or on any satisfactory
terms with a contemporary picture. Nevertheless,
in its successful reproduction of the tone of a bygone
epoch, lies Esmond's second and incontestable claim
to length of days. Athough fifty years and more
have passed since it was published, it is still unrivalled
as the typical example of that class of historical
fiction, which, dealing indiscriminately with characters
real and feigned, develops them both with equal
familiarity‚ treating them each from within, and
investing them impartially with a common atmosphere
of illusion. No modern novel has done this in the
same way, nor with the same good fortune, as
Esmond3 and there is nothing more to be said on
this score. Even if—as always—later researches
should have revised our conception of certain of
the real personages, the value of the book as an
imaginative tour de force is unimpaired. Little
remains therefore for the gleaner of to-day save
bibliographical jottings, and neglected notes on its
first appearance.
