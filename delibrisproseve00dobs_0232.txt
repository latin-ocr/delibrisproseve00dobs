Addison has been less studied3 and his likeness has
consequently been less questioned. Concerning

Thackeray's sketch is very vivid, very human, and
in most essentials, hard to disprove, must be granted.
But it is obviously conceived under the domination
of the “ poor Dick '' of Addison, and dwells far too
persistently upon Steele's frailer and more fallible
aspect. No one would believe that the flushed
personage in the full-bottomed periwig, who hic-

renegades . . . with 3 scornful pity for them in spite of all their genius and

greatness.'’
