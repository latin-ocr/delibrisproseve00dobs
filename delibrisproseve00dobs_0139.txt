beginning with 1868. In 1877 she contributed
to the Royal Academy a water colour entitled
“Musiiig,'' and in 1889 was elected a member of
the Royal Institute of Painters in Water Colours.

By this date, as will be gathered from what has
preceded, Miss Greenaway had made her mark as a
producet of children's books, since, in addition to
the volumes already specially mentioned, she had
issued Under the Wndow (her earliest success), The
Language of Flowers, Kate Greenaway's Painting
Book, lee Book of Games, King Pepito and other
works. Her last “ Almanack,'’ which was published
by Messrs Dent and Co., appeared in 1897. In
1891, the Fine Arts Society exhibited some 150
of her original drawings-——an exhibition which was
deservedly successful, and was followed by others.1
As Slade Professor at Oxford, Ruskin, always her
fervent admirer, gave her unstinted eulogium3
and in France her designs aroused the greatest
admiration. The De'bats had a leading article on
her death; and the elever author of L’Art du
Rire‚ M. Arsene Alexandre, who had already written
appreciatively of her gifts as a “paysagisteJ‘ and as
a “maitresse en l'art du sourire, du joli sourire

¹ Among other things these exhibitions revealed the great superiority of the
original designs to the reproductions with which the public are familiar—
excellent as these are in their way. Probably, if Miss Greenaway's work
were now repeated by the latest form of three-colom· p ssssssss he would be
less an “ inheritor ''—in this respect—“ of unfulfilletl renown.‘'
