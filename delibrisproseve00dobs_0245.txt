FRESH FACTS ABOUT FIELDING

THE general reader, as a rule, is but moderately
interested in minor rectifications. Secure in a conven-
tional preference of the spirit to the letter, he pro-
fesses to be indifferent whether the grandmother of
an exalted personage was a “ Hugginson'’ or a
“ Blenkinsop'' ; and he is equally careless as to the
correct Christian names of his cousins and his aunts.
In the main, the general reader is wise in his genera-
tion. But with the painful biographer, toiling in
the immeasurable sand of thankless research, often
foot-sore and dry of throat, these trivialities assume
exaggerated proportions; and to those who remind
him-—as in a cynical age he is sure to be reminded—
of the infinitesimal value of his hard-gotten grains of
information‚ he can only reply mournfussy, if uncon-
vincingly, that fact is fact—even in matters of
mustard-seed. With this prelude, I propose to set
down one or two minute points concerning Henry
Fielding, not yet comprised in any existing records of

his career.¹·

¹ Since this was published in April 1907, they have been embodied in an
Appendix to my “Men of Letters ’' Fielding3 and used, to some extent, for a
fresh edition of the Journal osa Voyage to Lisbon (“ World‘s Classics ”).
