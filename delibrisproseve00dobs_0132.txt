dedication contains a charming row of tiny portraits
of the Locker-Lampson family. These illustrations
may seem to contradict what has been said as to Miss
Greenaway's ability to interpret the conceptions of
others. But this particular task left her perfectly
free to “ go her own gait,'' and to embroider the text
which, in this case, was little more than a pretext for
her pencil.

In Marigold Garden, 1885, Miss Greenaway
became her own poet; and next to Motlzer Goose,
this is probably her most important effort. The
flowers are as entrancing as ever; and the verse
makes one wish that the writer had written more.
The “Genteel Family’' and “Little Phillis'' are
excellent nursery pieces; and there is almost a Blake-
like note about “ The Sun Door.”

They saw it rise in the morning,
They saw it set at night,

And they longed to go and see it,
Ah l if they only might.

The little soft white clouds heard thern,

And stepped from out of the blue ;
And each laid a little child softly
Upon its bosom of dew.

And they carried them higher and higher‚
And they nothing knew any more,
Until they were standing waiting,
In front of the round gold door.
