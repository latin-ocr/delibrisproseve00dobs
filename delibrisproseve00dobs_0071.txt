M. ROUQUET ΟΝ THE ARTs 47

Like Moser, Rouquet was a chaser and an enameller.
He lodged on the south side of Leicester Fields,
in a house afterwards the residence of another
Switzer of the same craft, that miserable Theodore
Gardelle, who in 1761 murdered his landlady, Mrs.
King. Of Rouquet's activities as an artist in
England there are scant particulars, The ordinary
authorities affirm that he imitated and rivalled the
popular miniaturist and enameller, Christian Zincke,
who retired from practice in 1746 ; and he is loosely
described as “the companion of Hogarth, Garrick,
Foote, and the wits of the day.” Of his relations
with Foote and Garrick there is scant record; but
with Hogarth, his near neighbour in the Fields,
he was certainly well acquainted, since in 1746 he
prepared explanations in French for a number of
Hogarth's prints. These took the form of letters
to a friend at Paris, and are supposed to have been,
if not actually inspired, at least approved by the
painter. They usually accompanied all the sets of
Hogarth's engravings which went abroad3 and,
according to George Steevens, it was Hogarth's
intention ultimately to have them translated and
enlarged- Rouquet followed these a little later by
a separate description of “ The March to Finchley,’'
designed specially for the edification of Marshal
Foucquet de Belle-Isle, who, when the former letters
had been written, was a prisoner of war at Windsor.
